# Primitive-3d

Primitive-3D is a learning project that explores the fundamentals of 3D computer graphics without relying on modern graphics APIs like OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX. Instead of depending on hardware-accelerated pipelines, this project focuses on manually manipulating a color buffer at the pixel level to render shapes, grids, and even 3D-like projections.

The aim is to understand how graphics rendering works at the most basic levelâ€”starting from drawing grids and primitive shapes and slowly building toward more complex structures in 3D space.

This project is what we call as software rendered graphics - which is slower than hardware accelerated graphics but provides me and anyone following through the commits of this repo with a good understanding of how 3d graphics works - from the very root - like manipulating each and every pixel level root ( you are at the lowest point ) - this is now graphics or text is written in some of the more unconventional embedded stuff. 

Maybe we can have a website explaining all of it and the resources used after I finish this - yup will do that.

## Draw Grid:

```cpp
void draw_grid(){
    for(int i = 0 ; i < window_height; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < window_width ; j++) {
            if ( j % 10 == 0 || i % 10 == 0) {
                color_buffer[window_width * j + i] = 0x00000000;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here we are manually manipulating the color_buffer to change the color of the pixels at that particular position.


## Draw Square / Rectangle

![Black Square in White Background](images/black_square_white_background.png)

```cpp
void drawSquare(int posx, int posy, int width, int height, uint32_t color){
    int beginx = std::max(0, posx);
    int beginy = std::max(0, posy); 

    int endx = std::min(widow_width, beginx + width);
    int endy = std::min(window_height, beginy + height);

    for(int y = beginy ; y < endy ; y++){
        for(int x = beginx; x < endx ; x++){
            color_buffer[(width * y) + x] = color;
        }
    }
}
```

## Draw a bitmap
