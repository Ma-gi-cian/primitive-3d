# Primitive-3d

This is a repository for learning 3d graphics from an unorthodox method of not using any graphics api like opengl or stuff.

This repo is based on the course : [pikuma 3d computer graphics programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming).

The course, appears to be good, so lets see how it goes, there are certain differences, the original course is in c but I will be using cpp just translating the stuff.
